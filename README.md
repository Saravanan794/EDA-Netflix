# Netflix EDA Analysis

## Overview
This project involves performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Netflix data using Python. The analysis aims to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that can help understand the content and user engagement on Netflix.

## Objectives
- Understand the structure and content of the Netflix dataset.
- Analyze trends in content production and user preferences.
- Explore relationships between different variables in the dataset.
- Visualize key findings to make the analysis intuitive and impactful.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about Netflix content, including:
- **Title**: Name of the show or movie.
- **Type**: Whether the content is a TV Show or a Movie.
- **Release Year**: The year the content was released.
- **Genres**: Categories the content belongs to.
- **Country**: Country of production.
- **Duration**: Length of the movie or number of seasons for TV shows.
- **Ratings**: Age group suitability of the content.
- **Added Date**: Date the content was added to Netflix.

### Source
The dataset can be downloaded from [Kaggle's Netflix Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com).

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: Programming language used for analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development environment.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, correct data types, and remove duplicates.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Content distribution by type (TV Show vs Movie).
   - Year-wise trend of content release.
   - Top genres and countries producing Netflix content.
   - Duration analysis for movies and TV shows.
   - Popular ratings and their distribution.
3. **Visualization**: Use charts and graphs to represent insights.

## How to Run the Analysis
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Install required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook netflix_eda.ipynb
   ```
4. Follow the steps in the notebook to perform the analysis.

## Sample Visualizations
Some of the visualizations include:
- Bar charts for content type distribution.
- Line plots for year-wise content trends.
- Heatmaps for country-wise content production.
- Box plots for duration analysis.

## Insights
- Movies dominate the Netflix catalog compared to TV Shows.
- A surge in content addition is observed post-2015.
- The United States leads in content production, followed by India and the UK.
- Family and Drama are among the most popular genres.

## Future Work
- Incorporate user ratings and reviews to analyze content performance.
- Use machine learning to predict trends in content preferences.
- Explore regional preferences for better targeting strategies.
